# chord-diagrams
My study of chord diagrams is motivated by its relevance to statistical physics models. Most notably the SYK (Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) model and the Parisi's hypercube model (arXiv:cond-mat/9410088). In both models it is the intersecting structures of the chord diagrams that are essential. The central theme is combinatorics, and there will be mathematica codes (.nb files).
